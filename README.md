# AntisociaL

This is a social media project called AntisociaL. It's just something I did while learning react to get familiar with the concepts. I had help from youtube videos

## Features

It functions like a regular social media app. at least that's the intention but i had a few bugs along the way. here are the features:-

1. Register a user
2. Login
3. create and upload posts
4. follow other users
5. send messages to other users

## Getting Started

to use the app, you'd need the AntisociaL-api and Antisocial-socket applications and also install all the needed dependencies. you can do that with `npm install`. you can get the AntisociaL-api and AntisociaL-socket here:

- [link to api](https://github.com/pasta022/AntisociaL-api)
- [link to socket](https://github.com/pasta022/AntisociaL-socket)

## Limitations

there are a few bugs/limitations on this project. they include:-

- project is not responsive
- follow button on a user profile not functioning as it should
- search feature not enabled
- error handling
- pictures are uploaded locally to the api and not a database
- edit profile feature not included
- logs user out after every refresh(context api issue??)
